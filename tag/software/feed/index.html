<p>Samsung is on the verge of terminating its DeX support for devices working on Windows 7 and macOS in January 2022. Samsung recently updated its website dedicated to DeX with the revelation of putting an end to its support for both of these operating systems. Nevertheless, the DeX support continues in other devices such as external monitors and PCs using Windows 10 as well as Windows 11.</p>



<p>According to the Samsung website’s DeX page, “the DeX for PC service for Mac/Windows 7 OS will be terminated as of January 2022. For any further questions or assistance, please contact us through Samsung Members.”</p>



<p>A similar memo reached out to some of the Mac device owners on Reddit, indicating that the macOS users will be able to use the previously installed DeX on their devices, however, they may not be able to receive further support and updates in the future. No further downloads will be available for the people using these two operating systems after January 2022.</p>



<p>Samsung’s DeX feature is a feature that lets you connect your devices supporting DeX, to monitors and PCs and start using your phone in desktop mode. The DeX interface appears similar to Windows, thus helping users do multitask to complete their work without having to close any of the open applications they are currently working on. This function can be used in Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE, which when attached to a keyboard switches to desktop mode. In addition to this, your phone can also be projected in a DeX mode on the supported PCs and monitors.</p>



<p>Most of the PC owners have already made a shift from Windows 7 and mostly use Windows 10, and therefore, the end of support doesn’t matter to the PC owners. Meanwhile, the Mac users using a Samsung device will be required to make adjustments to work upon the upcoming change.</p><p>The post <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com/samsung-to-ditch-dex-support-for-windows-7-and-macos/">Samsung to ditch DeX support for Windows 7 and macOS</a> first appeared on <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com">canon.com/ijsetup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlicensed error or activation failed in Microsoft may appear during the product key activation process. In this case, you won’t be able to use any of the Office apps. To restore all features in Microsoft using key code, you have to perform a few steps.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/axpPU1Pe1zH_bI9JqWo5jD1pu_8f3PTXcMUl2VgUWtk6dfGH9V_tUaRx0feXPSAe1HuRWjWqJNGZTUPmvtZ8BjEflDjT_fZluw97r8zQHEJwPOtftnT-xTCeCxzBES4nApLnnqOWyS1IY_3ShQ=s0" alt="D:\anjali content work\blogs\microsoft blogs\How do you fix Microsoft unlicensed product error.png" /></figure>



<p>If you redeem your product key at Microsoft365.com/setup or office.com/setup, then you won’t experience an unlicensed process when you install Office apps from the official site.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>To resolve the activation failed or unlicensed error, follow the below steps;</p>



<h3><strong>Step 1 – Make sure you Sign In with the correct account details.</strong></h3>



<p>When you bought the product key from any platform, you should have used an account of Microsoft service. It’s the same account that you have to use for key activation. You might face such errors if you signed in to a different account not linked to your purchased services. Therefore, visit office.com and sign in to the correct account now.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can otherwise go to account.microsoft.com/services webpage and see if your Microsoft product is listed here. If yes, then you have to use the same account for activation.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 2 – Install only one copy of Office, uninstall additional.</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve installed several copies of Microsoft Office, most of the chances are that activation errors occur. In this case, uninstall the additional office copies to make it error-free. follow steps;</p>



<ul><li>Open control panel using Start Menu.</li><li>Hover the mouse pointer to&nbsp;<strong>Programs and Features.</strong></li><li>Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Search Programs and Features&nbsp;</strong>box and search Office.</li><li>You’ll see multiple versions in a list.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UjVntY6AHHbZ_l5Y39WAj2hsqfzu_o3-Gd_WrAys8XuOOc9VQX-q0Hf8uuE8Wr-rtmLxDjt2JN2WSks5gLckKKMzJZy6sLgVyf4eHQfAv08HjDE5UwlibpfgG0fphU84WMYADUb82KbVtD4ztA=s0" alt="D:\anjali content work\blogs\microsoft blogs\Install only one copy of Office, uninstall additional.png" /></figure>



<ul><li>Choose a version that you don’t use now and right-click on it.</li><li>Click Uninstall.</li><li>Now, restart your PC and launch an application of Microsoft Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Click sign in and enter Microsoft account login details correctly.</li><li>If apps are still not working, repair apps or try step 3.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Step 3 – See your Microsoft subscription status.</strong></h3>



<p>It simply means that your subscription should not be expired. The expired subscription stop working on Office apps; hence you need to renew it. To check the status;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pDaKWz4BFWb8lDICgijBV3MdeI-t1ZX08UG3sfeZuvmsXkockEBBfT36FVYtqmtMLIkQsq-68jzT0_eh9_4pjyNs_KhMCXiGVzxPXF_ZqdWSuVcwo50Rhku5F-KaHngsxLnse2OFc8cSDEbeHw=s0" alt="D:\anjali content work\blogs\microsoft blogs\See your Microsoft subscription status.png" /></figure>



<ul><li>Close Microsoft Office apps if running in the background.</li><li>Sign in to office.com with your account.</li><li>Open Services &amp; Subscription page from your account top tabs.</li><li>Under the Subscriptions heading, you can see all details of your product.</li><li>If the expired key is the activation error, then renew it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>If the issue is still not solved, install Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant tool. Also, you have to make sure that your system date, time is according to your location. One more point you’ve to remember is that sometimes updating Office resolves this issue where you need to see system firewall as well.</p><p>The post <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com/how-do-you-fix-microsoft-unlicensed-product-error/">How do you fix Microsoft unlicensed product error</a> first appeared on <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com">canon.com/ijsetup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
