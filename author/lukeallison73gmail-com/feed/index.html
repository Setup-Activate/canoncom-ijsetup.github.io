										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img loading="lazy" alt="D:\WEBSITE CONTENT\Canon'\blog\pic\Fix 5b00 Error in Canon Printer.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/T8Oe12RYRFIsAHHpOoPmawF4-vz4xmuayBFuGr6Uz0kUubH-twIvIyeqUZVVZuazza0kuUxLKdD0ecOXmnYqXCKgcuj2936MYQUprUO5AAG2Q4siFhglUALz49UXY7SYXOI7-IUOMa0wNsy7Z0Y" width="624" height="331"></strong></p>



<p>Canon printers absorb excess ink while printing a document. The printer will print pages until the waste ink tank doesn&#8217;t get full. But if you&#8217;ve started seeing an error code 5b00 in your printer display, then you need to resolve it. This article will let you know how you can fix the 5b00 error and start a trouble-free printing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why does error code 5b00 occur?</h2>



<p>The error 5b00 on your Canon printer display represents that the ink absorber is about to the full, and you need to zero it soon. Though the printer boosts just like another day, print, scan, or other features will encounter trouble, or you&#8217;ll see 8-10 times lamp flash frequently without resulting in an output.</p>



<h2>How to solve canon printer error code 5b00?</h2>



<p>The error 5b00 in your canon printer may occur again when the machine ink absorber gets full again. Hence, read all instructions so that next time you solve the error 5b00, you&#8217;ll know how to resolve it in a better way;</p>



<p>Make sure your printer ink level in the cartridge is full. If the ink level is low, replace it.</p>



<h3>Fix through Resetting software or service tool:-</h3>



<p>Resetting software is generally called&nbsp;<em>Canon Service Tool</em>&nbsp;and is available on the canon printer site. This tool maintains the device and overcomes the 5b00 issue on your canon printer. Canon Service Tool is used when you replace any of the machine parts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NfOWHnXVD5ydprP8XvQZWXaH636WTonqSRfKrMaFNdH5tWEjJ4ug89VmW-xaPArFwDHBu3ynhUiG8sSuKivRhkChqyOkRteckvKVFm_BLNsBTnCCQRa5rsWslGBp5nhztq7uKFr6wTEVErby3z4" alt="D:\WEBSITE CONTENT\Canon'\blog\pic\Download the V3400 version - canon pritner tool.png" /></figure>



<ol><li>Download the V3400 version from the canon printer official site.</li><li>Double-click on the V3400 canon service installer tool to run on your PC.&nbsp;</li><li>During the installation, you&#8217;ve to set up the printer into service mode.</li><li>Connect the power cable to the switch outlet.</li><li>Now, press and hold the resume button and power button.</li><li>Then, release the resume button, but 5 times the power button is still holding.</li><li>Release the resume and power buttons.</li></ol>



<h3>Reset the waste ink counter:-</h3>



<ol><li>Unplug all the connections and cables from your printer. E.g., main power source, USB connection.</li><li>Reconnect the power cord to the printer and plug it into the wall outlet.</li><li>Press down the power ON button and hold until the printer resets itself.</li><li>If you see all the lights stable on your Canon printer model, release the ON button.</li><li>When the green light stops flashing, press and release the ON button twice.</li><li>The green light blinks again and gets stable.</li></ol>



<p>If you still can&#8217;t print with the same error of getting waste ink counter full, then try the manual method of cleaning waste ink foam;</p>



<h3>Clean Waste Ink Foam:-</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kkGs7UHDEGuNMkQBh4P1blu9RC0toC6OpKomLs_ZdX3fsDK2rssI5ckvsdN-l2LsLm-QJxfzKZyUpOxCyfqIPy6c1sLPISgH7DWX_Yhw8T7dKVdZSR8cD8N2KaEUFPqmT-TM0YUjvHraPSue3Z8" alt="D:\WEBSITE CONTENT\Canon'\blog\pic\Reset the waste ink counter.png" /></figure>



<ol><li>Open the printer lid.</li><li>Ensure you see the cartridges and rollers inside.</li><li>Don&#8217;t touch rollers.</li><li>You can see the small square box seems like a foam pad. Clean the foam pad using a soft cloth. Push the foam to leak down the link.</li><li>Continue cleaning the foam till all ink is clean.</li><li>Now, assemble the canon printer.</li><li>Place the cartridges in the correct location and close the lid you opened first.</li><li>Now on restart your printer and try printing a document to check whether it&#8217;s printing smoothly or not.</li></ol>



<p>If you still see the error 5b00 in your canon printer display, then it&#8217;s time to contact the canon printer support team.</p><p>The post <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com/fix-5b00-error-in-canon-printer/">Fix 5b00 Error in Canon Printer</a> first appeared on <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com">canon.com/ijsetup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Perforce Software will soon get the new functionality. The solutions provider to enterprise teams requiring visibility, productivity, and scale along the improvement lifecycle has recently announced a new feature to boost the discovered defects remediation in automated scans.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is conveyed through incorporation with Secure Code Warrior (SCW). In SCW, Klocwork customers have the interface option immediately with resources that disclose how to moderate vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>SAST tools identify relevant SCW learning resources and security vulnerabilities and connecting both shows that the Secure Code Warrior learning platform and the Klocwork have the option to empower developers to remediate errors rapidly and upgrade their range of abilities continuously.</p>



<p>DevOps evangelist at Perforce, Eran Kinsbruner, says that developers need a simplified, consistent method for accessing the fundamental security training while additionally keeping up with code development speed. He added that for development teams, they’ve made it easy to learn as they go with this integration via the relevant interface at the applicable time.</p>



<p>Eran said that their gained knowledge lets developers work faster and smarter to push projects ahead.</p>



<p>For developers, an engaging experience occurred having the secure coding integration with relevant skills-based pathways to compose secure code at speed.</p>



<p>The SAST tools detect security vulnerabilities and connect the vulnerabilities SCW learning resources running within the developer desktop tools, or we can say as part of the CI/CD pipelines is indicating that the Secure Code Warrior learning platform and Klocwork empower developers to remediate errors rapidly and consistently improve their range of abilities.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity is something that’s always the concern for enterprises across the software development spectrum, the adoption of secure application development culture across each team that contacts the SDLC is a significant guard line.</p>

<p>Samsung is on the verge of terminating its DeX support for devices working on Windows 7 and macOS in January 2022. Samsung recently updated its website dedicated to DeX with the revelation of putting an end to its support for both of these operating systems. Nevertheless, the DeX support continues in other devices such as external monitors and PCs using Windows 10 as well as Windows 11.</p>



<p>According to the Samsung website’s DeX page, “the DeX for PC service for Mac/Windows 7 OS will be terminated as of January 2022. For any further questions or assistance, please contact us through Samsung Members.”</p>



<p>A similar memo reached out to some of the Mac device owners on Reddit, indicating that the macOS users will be able to use the previously installed DeX on their devices, however, they may not be able to receive further support and updates in the future. No further downloads will be available for the people using these two operating systems after January 2022.</p>



<p>Samsung’s DeX feature is a feature that lets you connect your devices supporting DeX, to monitors and PCs and start using your phone in desktop mode. The DeX interface appears similar to Windows, thus helping users do multitask to complete their work without having to close any of the open applications they are currently working on. This function can be used in Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE, which when attached to a keyboard switches to desktop mode. In addition to this, your phone can also be projected in a DeX mode on the supported PCs and monitors.</p>



<p>Most of the PC owners have already made a shift from Windows 7 and mostly use Windows 10, and therefore, the end of support doesn’t matter to the PC owners. Meanwhile, the Mac users using a Samsung device will be required to make adjustments to work upon the upcoming change.</p><p>The post <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com/samsung-to-ditch-dex-support-for-windows-7-and-macos/">Samsung to ditch DeX support for Windows 7 and macOS</a> first appeared on <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com">canon.com/ijsetup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlicensed error or activation failed in Microsoft may appear during the product key activation process. In this case, you won’t be able to use any of the Office apps. To restore all features in Microsoft using key code, you have to perform a few steps.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/axpPU1Pe1zH_bI9JqWo5jD1pu_8f3PTXcMUl2VgUWtk6dfGH9V_tUaRx0feXPSAe1HuRWjWqJNGZTUPmvtZ8BjEflDjT_fZluw97r8zQHEJwPOtftnT-xTCeCxzBES4nApLnnqOWyS1IY_3ShQ=s0" alt="D:\anjali content work\blogs\microsoft blogs\How do you fix Microsoft unlicensed product error.png" /></figure>



<p>If you redeem your product key at Microsoft365.com/setup or office.com/setup, then you won’t experience an unlicensed process when you install Office apps from the official site.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>To resolve the activation failed or unlicensed error, follow the below steps;</p>



<h3><strong>Step 1 – Make sure you Sign In with the correct account details.</strong></h3>



<p>When you bought the product key from any platform, you should have used an account of Microsoft service. It’s the same account that you have to use for key activation. You might face such errors if you signed in to a different account not linked to your purchased services. Therefore, visit office.com and sign in to the correct account now.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can otherwise go to account.microsoft.com/services webpage and see if your Microsoft product is listed here. If yes, then you have to use the same account for activation.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 2 – Install only one copy of Office, uninstall additional.</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve installed several copies of Microsoft Office, most of the chances are that activation errors occur. In this case, uninstall the additional office copies to make it error-free. follow steps;</p>



<ul><li>Open control panel using Start Menu.</li><li>Hover the mouse pointer to&nbsp;<strong>Programs and Features.</strong></li><li>Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Search Programs and Features&nbsp;</strong>box and search Office.</li><li>You’ll see multiple versions in a list.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UjVntY6AHHbZ_l5Y39WAj2hsqfzu_o3-Gd_WrAys8XuOOc9VQX-q0Hf8uuE8Wr-rtmLxDjt2JN2WSks5gLckKKMzJZy6sLgVyf4eHQfAv08HjDE5UwlibpfgG0fphU84WMYADUb82KbVtD4ztA=s0" alt="D:\anjali content work\blogs\microsoft blogs\Install only one copy of Office, uninstall additional.png" /></figure>



<ul><li>Choose a version that you don’t use now and right-click on it.</li><li>Click Uninstall.</li><li>Now, restart your PC and launch an application of Microsoft Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Click sign in and enter Microsoft account login details correctly.</li><li>If apps are still not working, repair apps or try step 3.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Step 3 – See your Microsoft subscription status.</strong></h3>



<p>It simply means that your subscription should not be expired. The expired subscription stop working on Office apps; hence you need to renew it. To check the status;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pDaKWz4BFWb8lDICgijBV3MdeI-t1ZX08UG3sfeZuvmsXkockEBBfT36FVYtqmtMLIkQsq-68jzT0_eh9_4pjyNs_KhMCXiGVzxPXF_ZqdWSuVcwo50Rhku5F-KaHngsxLnse2OFc8cSDEbeHw=s0" alt="D:\anjali content work\blogs\microsoft blogs\See your Microsoft subscription status.png" /></figure>



<ul><li>Close Microsoft Office apps if running in the background.</li><li>Sign in to office.com with your account.</li><li>Open Services &amp; Subscription page from your account top tabs.</li><li>Under the Subscriptions heading, you can see all details of your product.</li><li>If the expired key is the activation error, then renew it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>If the issue is still not solved, install Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant tool. Also, you have to make sure that your system date, time is according to your location. One more point you’ve to remember is that sometimes updating Office resolves this issue where you need to see system firewall as well.</p><p>The post <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com/how-do-you-fix-microsoft-unlicensed-product-error/">How do you fix Microsoft unlicensed product error</a> first appeared on <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com">canon.com/ijsetup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google brings forth some new apps on Play Store for the Wear OS devices to ease down the accessibility for the owners.</p>



<p>In an attempt to make an app search for the smartwatches faster, Google is introducing new apps in the Google Play Store to be installed on your Android devices. The apps and features that include brand-new filters on searching for “watch” or “watch face” will now be available on the Play Store search query. Google is also making an effort to emphasize the best of the wrist apps and the collections of other features in the chosen Wear OS and watch faces segments of the Play Store.</p>



<p>It is evident that Google is working on refining and simplifying the Play Store experience related to smartwatches for its users. Easy-to-tap cards are popularizing on this version of the Play Store.</p>



<p>This version of the Play Store even allows you to make an in-app purchase by constantly prompting the purchase page and opening it on your Android device or a URL opening in your web browser, so as to easily do with the payment.</p>



<p>These interesting updates will be made available in the Play Store on Wear OS and Android in a couple of weeks. They are initially being acquainted with the Wear OS devices, yet the advancements to the accessibility and browsing apps will also be advantageous for the upcoming operating system being developed by Google and Samsung in partnership. Samsung is set to announce the first consumer product called Wear that will run on the upcoming software. The announcement may be made later this year. Samsung even displayed a preview of the interface appearance of its next generation of Galaxy smartwatches.</p><p>The post <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com/google-eases-finding-wear-os-apps-on-play-store/">Google eases finding Wear OS apps on Play Store</a> first appeared on <a href="https://canonsetup-canon.com">canon.com/ijsetup</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
